### Abstract

The increasing adoption of generative AI (GenAI) tools such as chatbot in education presents new op-
portunities to support students’ self-regulated learning (SRL), but also raises concerns about how learners actually
engage in planning, executing, and reflection when learning with a chatbot. While SRL is typically conceptualized
as a sequential process, little is known about how it unfolds during real-world student–chatbot interactions. To
explore this, we proposed Gen-SRL, an annotation schema to categorize student prompts into 16 microlevel actions
across 4 macrolevel phases. Using the proposed schema, we annotated 212 chatbot interactions from a real-world
English writing task. We then performed frequency analysis and process mining (PM) techniques to discover SRL
patterns in depth. Our results revealed that students’ SRL behaviours were imbalanced, with over 82% of actions
focused on task execution and limited engagement in planning and reflection. In addition, the process analysis
showed nonsequential regulation patterns. Our findings suggest that classical SRL theories cannot fully capture
the dynamic SRL patterns that emerge during chatbot interactions. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of
designing adaptive and personalized scaffolds that respond to students’ dynamic behaviours in chatbot-powered
contexts. More importantly, this study offers a new perspective for advancing SRL research and suggest directions
for developing chatbots that better support self-regulation
