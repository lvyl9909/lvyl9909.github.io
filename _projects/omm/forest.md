#### Workforce Analytics &times; Process Mining: A Perfect Match

‚úÖ Business process execution data --- readily available in many enterprise
  information systems --- is a promising source for workforce analytics

‚úÖ We develop process mining methods that systematically exploit process
  data and support organizations to better understand their employees and
  continually improve HR decisions alongside core business processes

#### Demo
The following demo is based on a case study conducted using data from
five municipalities working with a building permit handling process (data
source: BPI Challenge 2015).

##### Compare across groups and time periods

<div class="row my-3">
<figure class="figure mx-auto text-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/research-omm/forest/4-demo_compare.png' | relative_url }}"
  class="figure-img img-fluid border rounded" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">
    Productivity of five municipalities based on the amount of completed
    cases across a four-year period: The trend is similar while unique
    patterns exist.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

##### Understand groups from multiple dimensions

<div class="row my-3">
<figure class="figure mx-auto text-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/research-omm/forest/5-demo_multidim.png' | relative_url }}"
  class="figure-img img-fluid border rounded" style="width: 60%;" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">
    Workload of the five municipalities: <br>
    Their focuses on different process tasks seem to align (left), but 
    municipality #1 have its own working hours arrangements on Wednesdays (right)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

##### Explore and highlight patterns at different levels

<div class="row my-3">
<figure class="figure mx-auto text-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/research-omm/forest/6-demo_different_times.png' | relative_url }}"
  class="figure-img img-fluid border rounded" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">
    Expand the data on different time levels: the unique ‚Äúbatch working‚Äù 
    behavior of municipality #4 in certain months
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="row">
<figure class="figure mx-auto text-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/research-omm/forest/6-demo_within_group.png' | relative_url }}"
  class="figure-img img-fluid border rounded" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">
    Drill down to within-group analyses: individual workload distributions 
    manifesting employees‚Äô role differences
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

##### Plug-in tailored measures to cater for different analyses

<div class="row my-3">
<figure class="figure mx-auto text-center">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/research-omm/forest/7-demo_measure.png' | relative_url }}"
  class="figure-img img-fluid border rounded" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">
    Various measures can be applied according to the purposes: <br>
    Productivity of the five municipalities is again analyzed, but 
    measured by average case throughput time
