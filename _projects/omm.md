In recent years, alignment-based method has become the
de facto standard for conformance checking in computing con-
formance diagnostics, as it always returns the most accurate
deviations, known as optimal-alignment. However, as the com-
plexity of the log and model increases, the runtime complexity
of optimal alignment computation grows exponentially, leading
to extremely long computation timesâ€”sometimes even taking
several weeks. This makes them impractical for real-world ap-
plications. To tackle the problems, various approximation strategies
have been proposed. Notably, model behaviour sampling method provides 
an angle for approximate conformance checking, that is, selecting partial 
model traces to substitute process model.

My research looks into an enhanced model behaviour sampling method to 
select more representative subsets and get more accuracy approximate values.
We apply hierarchical clustering to the event log with a new proposed 
distance criterion. Then, we propose two in-cluster methods to select 
typical traces from each cluster. Finally, we extend existing cost lower 
bound algorithm to achieve more accurate approximation results.

Our framework for proposed methods, as illustrated below.

With this novel notion, our method lays the foundation of many exciting
futures being researched --- for example, can we use more advanced hierarchical
algorithm to obtain results? Keep an eye on us if you find this method interesting 
and practical --- the party has started ðŸ¥³!
