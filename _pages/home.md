I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at Queensland University of Technology (QUT),
Australia. I'm interested in discovering knowledge from process execution data
to support improved decision-making, especially knowledge about (human)
resources. 

My current research focuses on mining organizational models from process
execution data and applying them to workforce analytics [[read

I'm also involved in
[Foragecaster](https://www.agriwebb.com/foragecaster/){:target="_blank"}, a
project that aims at delivering a planner system, powered by accurate and
reliable machine learning models, to support farmers in decisions on forage,
grazing livestock, and farm sustainability.


I'm a member of the [Explainable Analytics for Machine Intelligence (XAMI)
Lab](https://www.xami-lab.org/){:target="_blank"} at QUT.
