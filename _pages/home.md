I am currently a Master’s student in Software Engineering at the University of 
Melbourne (Unimelb), Australia. I'm interested in process-aware data science, computer 
modelling and machine learning. As a software engineering master, I'm also involved in building open-source 
well-documented software. Throughout the project, I excelled as team leader, overseeing workflow coordination,
facilitating communication, and actively participating in all phases of development.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Texas Tech University, focusing on integrating 
generative AI, logic, and processes in education to enhance teaching quality and
learning outcome. My current research interests center on the combination of GenAI, logic, and 
process mining in education. 

Next semester, I will collaborate with Dr. Abel Armas 
Cervantes on a research project titled “Looking at LMS through a Process Lens,” which explores the
application of process mining in education.
