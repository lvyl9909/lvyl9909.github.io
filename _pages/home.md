I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Queensland University of Technology (QUT),
Australia. I'm interested in discovering knowledge from process execution data
to support improved decision-making, especially knowledge about (human)
resources, and process automation. 

My current research focuses on mining organizational models from process
execution data and applying them to workforce analytics [[read

I'm also involved in
[Foragecaster](https://www.agriwebb.com/foragecaster/){:target="_blank"}, a
project that aims at developing an AI-powered planner system to support farmers'
decisions on forage, grazing livestock, and farm sustainability. I lead the
research on data quality and explainability, where we develop systematic
framework and methods to evaluate key farm production data, diagnose and
repair potential data quality issues, and investigate their root causes to
improve future data management and ensure effective use of machine learning
models from a data-centric perspective.


I'm a member of the [Explainable Analytics for Machine Intelligence (XAMI)
Lab](https://www.xami-lab.org/){:target="_blank"} at QUT.
