I am currently a Master’s student in Software Engineering at the [University of 
Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}, Australia. I'm interested in applications of Artificial intelligent (AI) in education and process-aware data science. 
As a skilled software engineering master, I consistently served as the team leader, responsible for project management and core feature development.

Between Dec 2024 and Apr 2025, I served as a Research Assistant in Professor [Yuanlin Zhang](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/stem/membership/member_bios/yuanlin_zhang.php/){:target="_blank"}’s group
at [Texas Tech University](http://ttu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, exploring how GenAI and logic can together improve K-12 education.
