I am currently a Master‚Äôs student in Software Engineering at the [University of 
Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}, Australia. I'm interested in applications of Artificial intelligent (AI) in education and process-aware data science, though I remain enthusiastic about all areas of computer science.
As a skilled software engineering master, I consistently served as the team leader, responsible for project management and core function development.

Between Dec 2024 and Apr 2025, I served as a Research Assistant in Professor [Yuanlin Zhang](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/stem/membership/member_bios/yuanlin_zhang.php/){:target="_blank"}‚Äôs group
at [Texas Tech University](http://ttu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, exploring how AI and logic can together improve K-12 education.

#### Why I'm Outstanding

- üöÄ **Highly Self-Driven with Passion for Research**  
  Despite being in a coursework-based Master's program, I actively engaged in research projects. **Within the latest year, I contributed as the first or second author to 3 EI/Scopus-indexed journal papers and 4 IEEE conference papers**. I maintain a strong work ethic with an average of **14 hours of daily study and research**.

- üë®‚Äçüíª **Strong Project Management and Engineering Foundation**  
  I have consistently led software engineering projects as **scrum master**, responsible for both **management and core development**. Proficient in project management tools like **Jira** and **ZenTao** and programming languages like **Java** and **Python**.

- üß† **Adaptable and Fast Learner**  
  Unfamiliar field? I love the ride. My research interests span across [multiple fields](https://yilin.bio/interest/). I quickly adapt to new fields and reach publication-level proficiency, my supervisors are able to confirm it üòÜ.
