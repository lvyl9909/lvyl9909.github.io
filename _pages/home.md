I am currently a joint PhD student at [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.siat.ac.cn/) and [Beijing Normal University‚ÄìHong Kong Baptist University United International College](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/).
My research focuses on large language model (LLM)-driven social behavior simulation, spatiotemporal trajectory mining, and semantic trajectory inference. 

Between Dec 2024 and Apr 2025, I served as a Research Assistant in Professor [Yuanlin Zhang](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/stem/membership/member_bios/yuanlin_zhang.php/){:target="_blank"}‚Äôs group
at [Texas Tech University](http://ttu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, exploring how AI and logic can together improve K-12 education.
