I am currently a Masterâ€™s student in Software Engineering at the University of 
Melbourne (Unimelb), Australia. I'm interested in process-aware data science, computer 
modelling and machine learning.

My current research focuses on developing advanced algorithms for approximate conformance
checking between process execution data and models[[read more](/projects/omm)].

I'm also involved in
[Foragecaster](https://www.agriwebb.com/foragecaster/){:target="_blank"}, a
project that aims at developing an AI-powered planner system to support farmers'
decisions on forage, grazing livestock, and farm sustainability. I lead the
research on data quality and explainability, where we develop systematic
framework and methods to evaluate key farm production data, diagnose and
repair potential data quality issues, and investigate their root causes to
improve future data management and ensure effective use of machine learning
models from a data-centric perspective.
