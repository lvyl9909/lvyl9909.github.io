#### About me

- I'm a 3rd-year PhD student at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Australia. I'm interested in discovering knowledge from process execution data to support improved decision-making, especially knowledge about (human) resources. 
- My current research focuses on mining organizational models from process execution data and applying them for workforce analytics ([read more](./research)). 
- I'm also involved in a [Food Agility CRC](https://www.foodagility.com/people/roy-yang) project investigating how process modeling and predictive process analytics can be applied to facilitate complex decisions in crop production and sales planning. 
- I'm a member of the [Explainable Analytics for Machine Intelligence (XAMI) Lab](https://www.xami-lab.org/) at QUT.
